# CSE-480
Database Systems

Most project descriptions are no longer available, however here are some basic descriptions from what I remember a few years later:

Project 1: Create a Python program to convert between CSV, JSON, XML.

Project 2-5: Recreate some core functionalities of Python's built-in sqlite3 module (each project adds functionality to the same file from the previous week, as instructed).

Project 6: Create a Python program to save/load Databses to a file.
